nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "IPv4 validation prevents false positives (999.999.999.999 rejected). TLD whitelist prevents file extension confusion. Username regex uses word boundaries."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "LazyLock patterns compiled once. Pre-computed username regex at construction."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "IPv6 pattern handles multiple formats (full, compressed, loopback). Domain detection skips file extensions correctly."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "KNOWN_TLDS and FILE_EXTENSIONS lists are extensible. Code is well-documented."
