# Epic List

| Epic | Title | Goal |
|------|-------|------|
| **Epic 1** | Diagnostics Core & Data Collection | Establish the diagnostics module foundation with circular buffer, system metrics collection, event capture, and basic JSON export for validation |
| **Epic 2** | Anonymization & Export System | Implement comprehensive anonymization pipeline and polished export functionality (file + clipboard) with well-defined JSON schema |
| **Epic 3** | UI Integration | Add the Diagnostics screen to the application with status display, controls, and export buttons following IcedLens design patterns |

**Rationale:** Three epics provide clean separation of concerns while each delivering testable incremental value. Epic 1 delivers the core infrastructure that can be validated programmatically. Epic 2 adds the privacy layer and export mechanisms. Epic 3 completes the user-facing integration.
