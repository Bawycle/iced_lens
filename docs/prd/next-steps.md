# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

> Review the IcedLens Diagnostics Tool PRD (`docs/prd.md`), focusing on the UI Design Goals and Epic 3 (UI Integration). Evaluate the proposed Diagnostics screen design for usability, accessibility, and consistency with IcedLens's existing design language. Provide recommendations for the screen layout, component placement, and interaction patterns.

## Architect Prompt

> Review the IcedLens Diagnostics Tool PRD (`docs/prd.md`) and create the technical architecture for the diagnostics module. Focus on: module structure within `src/diagnostics/`, integration points with existing message handlers, thread model for the collector, data structures for events and buffer, and the anonymization pipeline. Ensure the design follows IcedLens's existing patterns (Elm/Iced architecture, newtypes, design tokens).
